- [The Case for Learned Index Structures (Kraska et. al., Dec 2017)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.01208)
	- Show how to implement neural-network-based 'learned indexes' that can replace B-Tree indexes.
		- Result: 70% speed improvement, save an order of magnitude in memory over several real-world datasets
			- Caveats: dataset fixed etc
	- To consider: implications of replacing indices with learned models for system design, software etc
