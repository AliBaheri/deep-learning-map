## Development Notes

#### 9 Dec 2017
- Add brainstormed list of topics to cover. The idea is to write (or link to) paper summaries, good blog posts or articles that will help people with limited experience get a better idea of what is going on in the field. This means:
	- Understanding what different models or terms mean
		- Knowing what the state-of-the-art results are in each domain
		- Being able to look up known advantages and disadvantages of key models and approaches
	- Seeing how different concepts connect with each other
- The target audience is not currently experienced researchers, but the hope is that researchers will eventually benefit from this as well.
- I will also be going through Goodfellow et. al's book 'Deep Learning' and may add insights or summaries from the book (referencing those appropriately.)
- Difficulties: it is hard to know how to connect concepts with each other initially, so I will first 
	- (1) write paper summaries,
	- (2) write a list of summaries of key terminology, and
	- (2) build a spreadsheet trying to list connections in parallel.
		- The spreadsheet is important: I believe that it will be greatly beneficial to have a visual map and not just a list of papers because the latter is much harder to digest.
- Everything will likely be scattered at first, but I hope the pieces will start coming together after the first month.
