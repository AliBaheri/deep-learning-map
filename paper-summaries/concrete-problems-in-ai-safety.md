**Tags**: 
- AI Safety
- Reinforcement Learning

## Summary

Discusses five areas (objectives) for AI safety research:
1. Avoid negative side effects
2. Avoid Reward Hacking
3. Scalable Oversight
	- TODO: add brief explanation
4. Safe exploration
5. Robustness to distributional shift
	- between train and test

<!--
- Wrong objective function
- Correct objective function, have method to evaluate it
-->
For each area, they discuss the research problems, current and promising approaches and potential experiments to conduct.


(Work in progress: writing much more detailed summary)
