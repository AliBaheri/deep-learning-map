# Datasets

Note: This page is currently more a list than an indicator of which are the 'main datasets' in research.

## Speech
- [Common Voice (Mozilla)](https://voice.mozilla.org/data)
	- 400 hours of speech from 400k recordings from 20k people.

## Robotics
- [RoboCupSimData](https://bitbucket.org/oliverobst/robocupsimdata/)
	- Over 180 hours of robot soccer gameplay.
	- [[Paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.01703) [[Data]](https://bitbucket.org/oliverobst/robocupsimdata/)

## Self-Driving Cars
- KITTI
- [TorontoCity Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.00423) (from U of Toronto, aimed to be released in 2018): 
	- 712.5km2 of land, 8k km of road, 400k buildings

## Images
- CIFAR-10
	Example image classification dataset: CIFAR-10. One popular toy image classification dataset is the CIFAR-10 dataset. This dataset consists of 60,000 tiny images that are 32 pixels high and wide. Each image is labeled with one of 10 classes (for example “airplane, automobile, bird, etc”). These 60,000 images are partitioned into a training set of 50,000 images and a test set of 10,000 images. In the image below you can see 10 random example images from each one of the 10 classes. (Source: CS231n)

## Action Classification and Localisation
- SLAC
	- 200 action classes, 520k videos, over 1.75M individual annotations
	- Labelled using AI systems and human feedback (/humans for clips AI system can't label with high confidence)
